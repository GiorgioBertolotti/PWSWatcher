# PWSWatcher

## Why?

PWSWatcher is an open-source Android app used to monitor a *PWS* (Personal Weather Station) given the link of its real-time updated *.xml* file.  
There was already another application for the same purpose, but no updates have been released since 2013, so I decided to develop one for anyone who wanted to monitor weather stations.
